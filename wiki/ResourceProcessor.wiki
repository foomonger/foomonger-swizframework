#summary Using the [Resource] custom metadata tag (v1.5.0beta2)
#labels Featured

Example [http://www.foomonger.com/swizframework/ResourceProcessorExample/ResourceProcessorExample.swf SWF] and [http://www.foomonger.com/swizframework/ResourceProcessorExample/srcview/ Source].

!ResourceProcessor binds a resource from the !ResourceManager singleton to the decorated property. It uses the IResource.getObject() method when binding so you can decorate properties of types supported by !ResourceManager.

Usage:

 # If using the source directly, add `Resource` to the list of metadata tags to keep when compiling. The `Resource` tag is included in the SWC as of v1.2.0.
 # Add !ResourceProcessor to the Swiz instance
 # Decorate methods with `[Resource]`. You must define `key` and `bundle` properties. E.g.  
  `[Resource(key="title", bundle="main")]`

  This intentionally mirrors the `@Resource` directive.
