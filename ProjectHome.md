The foomonger-swizframework project started because of the custom metadata processor SignalHandlerProcessor (formerly MediateSignalProcessor) which I think helps makes using Signals with Swiz brutally simple.

The source contains:
  1. FoomongerSwizFramework (Library)
  1. FoomongerSwizFrameworkTest (Test Project)
  1. Various example projects

Version 1.5.0 works with swiz-framework-v1.0.0 as3-signals-v0.8.

The SWCs on the download page reference all other frameworks externally. They also include the metadata tags for the processors.
